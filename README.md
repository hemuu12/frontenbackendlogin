Security
Password Storage: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for storage security.
Token Handling: JWT is used for token generation and validation.
Input Sanitization: Input validation and sanitization should be implemented to prevent injection attacks.
Design
Modular design with separate files for controllers, models, and routes.
Asynchronous operations managed using async/await for better code readability and maintenance.
Error Handling
Errors are caught and appropriate responses are sent back to the client with relevant error messages.
Improve error messages for better feedback to users.
Documentation
Inline comments should be added to explain each function's purpose and any design decisions.
A README file should be included in the repository to explain the project structure, setup instructions, and any other relevant information for developers.
